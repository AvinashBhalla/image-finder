# image-finder
This python script helps you find a particular image from a mass chunk of images . Very helpful for specific scenarios where you just have a reference image and you want to find look alike images .

If you are using without GUI script then you need to modify the image paths and destination folder manually in the script itself .

Improvements in process....

Good things take time !!
